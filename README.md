# Document Automation Project #
## Overview ##
This project automates the generation of Word documents using data from an Excel file. The script reads data from an Excel spreadsheet and replaces placeholders in Word document templates with the actual data, saving the modified documents in a specified output directory. This is particularly useful for generating personalized documents such as affidavits, agreements, and declarations based on standardized templates.
